# NumpyNet
NumpyNet is a small but working neuronal network lib. It follows the structure of the state of the art frameworks
like Tensorflow, Keras or PyTouch. The main purpose was to learn how to create such a deep learning library with the
most simplistic options

### Featured:
until now:
-- Dense
-- Softmax, Sigmoid & RelU
-- Cross Entropy, RootMeanSquaredError
-- Accuracy

### Environment
The code is written in Python 3.7 and a pipfile will install all dependencies

### Final data which will be used to test out the performance of the framework
Training data was cifar-10-batches-py from:
http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html

### first test:
